# Monk watching Fight
Once Monk was watching a fight between an array and a tree, of being better. Tree got frustrated and converted that array into a Binary Search Tree by inserting the elements as nodes in BST, processing elements in the given order in the array. Now Monk wants to know the height of the created Binary Search Tree.

Help Monk for the same.

Note:

In Binary Search Tree, the left sub-tree contains only nodes with values less than or equal to the parent node; the right sub-tree contains only nodes with values greater than the parent node.

Binary Search Tree with one node, has height equal to 1.

Input Format :

The first line will consist of 1 integer N, denoting the number of elements in the array. In next line, there will be N space separated integers, , where , denoting the elements of array.

Output Format

Print the height of the created Binary Search Tree.

Constraints: :

SAMPLE INPUT 4 2 1 3 4 SAMPLE OUTPUT 3 Explanation .

Insert 2. It becomes root of the tree. Insert 1. It becomes left child of 2. Insert 3. It becomes right child of 2. Insert 4. It becomes right child of 3. Final height of tree = 3.

# Frustrated coders
There are N frustrated coders standing in a circle with a gun in their hands. Each coder has a skill value S[ i ] and he can only kill those coders that have strictly less skill than him. One more thing, all the guns have only 1 bullet. This roulette can take place in any random order. Fortunately, you have the time stone (haaan wo harre wala) and you can see all possible outcomes of this scenario. Find the outcome where the total sum of the remaining coder's skill is minimum. Print this sum. Input Format The first line contains N the no. of coders The next line contains N elements where the ith element is theS[ i ] of ith coder.

# Hacker and traffic lights
Zolo is stuck in a traffic due to dysfunctional traffic light. Zolo is a professional hacker and he can get into the system and change the state of the light. His planet has different types of traffic lights such that there are N bulbs on the traffic board and only when all of them are green(G) the cars can pass. there are 2 other states also which the bulb can show; i.e. Red(R) & Yellow(Y). Note that the lights are designed such that they follow a state change cyclic pattern as follows: R------>Y------>G------->R Once Zolo gets into the system he can select any position i and update all elements between i to min(N, i + K - 1) by increasing their state by 1.This whole process takes 1 sec and he can repeat this process any no. of times until he gets all lights = G . Find the minimum time to do the process as Zolo is getting late for work.

Input Format
The first line contains N K The second line describes the current status of each bulb as an array whose each element can either be G or Y or R.

Output Format
Print the minimum amount of time required to clear the traffic jam".

# Remove Friends

After getting her PhD, Christie has become a celebrity at her university, and her Facebook profile is full of friend requests. Being the nice girl, she is, Christie has accepted all the requests. Now Kuldeep is jealous of all the attention she is getting from other guys, so he asks her to delete some of the guys from her friend list. To avoid a 'scene', Christie decides to remove some friends from her friend list, since she knows the popularity of each of the friend she has, she uses the following algorithm to delete a friend.

Algorithm Delete(Friend):
DeleteFriend=false for i = 1 to Friend.length-1 if (Friend[i].popularity < Friend[i+1].popularity) delete i th friend DeleteFriend=true break if(DeleteFriend == false) delete the last friend.
Input Format
First line contains T number of test cases. First line of each test case contains N, the number of friends Christie currently has and K ,the number of friends Christie decides to delete. Next lines contains popularity of her friends separated by space.
Output Format
For each test case print N-K numbers which represent popularity of Christie friend's after deleting K friends.
Constraints
1<=T<=1000 1<=N<=100000 0<=K< N 0<=popularity_of_friend<=100
NOTE: Order of friends after deleting exactly K friends should be maintained as given in input.

# Yatin plays PUBG
Yatin is playing PUBG and he has reached a place with a large staircase in front of him. And there is an enemy at each landing of the staircase. The staircase is analogous to a binary tree with each of its nodes as a landing of the staircase and each of its edges as stairs from one landing to another. Yatin wants to kill the maximum possible number of enemies. He can kill every person he can see from his position with his suppressed sniper gun. But he can see only the persons at the leftmost standing at each level and cannot see the rest. Before starting shooting them, he wants to know how many persons he can kill. He is busy keeping an eye on the enemies. So he wants you to find out the maximum number of people he can kill from that location by providing you with the analogous a binary search tree. [ Note: Players do not change their position after one player has died, i.e. the leftmost node remains the same even after player on that node has died. Or we can say that the nodes are not removed after the player on that node has died.]

Input Format
The first line of input contains a number t denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains n, the number of nodes in the tree. The second line of each test case contains n space separated integers (unique) ai denoting the value at each node of the BST. 11

# Haunted
The king of ghosts is really disappointed when he sees that all the human beings on Planet Earth have stopped fearing the ghost race. He knows the reason for this. The existing ghost race has become really lazy and has stopped visiting Planet Earth to scare the human race. Hence, he decides to encourage the entire ghost race into scaring the humans by holding a competition. The king, however, never visits Planet Earth. This competition will go on for N days. Currently, there are a total of M ghosts (apart from the king) existing in the ghost race such that : - The youngest ghost is 1 year old. - The oldest ghost is M years old. - No two ghosts have the same age. - The age of each and every ghost is a positive integer. On each day of the competition, ghosts have to visit Planet Earth to scare people. At the end of each day, a "Ghost of the Day" title is awarded to the ghost who scares the most number of humans on that particular day. However, the king of ghosts believes in consistency. Once this title has been given, the ghost who has won the most number of such titles until that particular moment is presented with a "Consistency Trophy". If there are many such ghosts, the oldest among them is given the trophy. Note that this "Title Giving" and "Trophy Giving" happens at the end of each day of the competition. You will be given the age of the ghost who won the "Ghost of the Day" title on each day of the competition. Your job is to find out the age of the ghost who was awarded with the "Consistency Trophy" on each day of the competition.

Input Format
The first line consists of 2 space separated integers N and M. The next line consists of N space separated integers such that the ith integer denotes the age of the ghost who was awarded with the "Ghost of the Day" title on the ith day of the competition.
Output Format
Print N lines. The ith line should contain 2 space separated integers such that the first integer denotes the age of the ghost who was 13 on the ith day and the second integer denotes the number of "Ghost of the Day" titles won by this ghost until the end of the ith day of the competition.
